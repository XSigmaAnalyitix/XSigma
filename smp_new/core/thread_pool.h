 * Thread Safety:
 * - All public methods are thread-safe and can be called from multiple threads.
 * - The pool uses a mutex and condition variables to synchronize access.
 * - Worker threads are joined in the destructor, ensuring clean shutdown.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If a task throws an exception, it is captured and rethrown after all
 *   tasks complete.
 *
 * NUMA Support:
 * - If a NUMA node ID is provided, threads are bound to that NUMA node
 *   for better performance on NUMA systems.
