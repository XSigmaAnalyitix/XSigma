## Decision-Making Process

### Authority Structure

**XSigmaAnalyitix maintainers have final authority** over all project decisions. While community input is valued and considered, **maintainers retain sole discretion** over:

- Contribution acceptance or rejection
- Feature prioritization and roadmap
- Architectural and design decisions
- Release timing and versioning
- Licensing and commercial terms
- Governance and policy changes

### Consensus-Based Decision Making (Among Maintainers)

XSigma maintainers use a **consensus-based decision-making model** for internal decisions:

1. **Proposal**: Anyone can propose changes via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests
2. **Community Discussion**: Community members discuss the proposal, providing feedback and suggestions
3. **Maintainer Review**: Maintainers review the proposal and community input
4. **Maintainer Consensus**: Maintainers work toward consensus among themselves
5. **Final Decision**: Maintainers make the final decision, which may accept, reject, or request revisions

**Important**: Community input is valued but **does not override maintainer authority**. Maintainers may accept or reject proposals regardless of community consensus.

### Types of Decisions

#### Minor Decisions

**Examples**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor refactoring

**Process**:
- Submit a pull request
- At least one maintainer review and approval required
- **Maintainer has sole discretion** to accept or reject
- Merge after approval and passing CI/CD checks

#### Major Decisions

**Examples**: New features, API changes, architectural changes, dependency additions

**Process**:
- Open a GitHub Issue for discussion before implementation
- Gather community feedback (minimum 7 days for significant changes)
- Maintainers review and discuss
- Consensus among maintainers sought (but not required)
- **Maintainers have final authority** regardless of community input
- Implementation via pull request with standard review process

#### Critical Decisions

**Examples**: License changes, governance changes, major breaking changes

**Process**:
- Open a GitHub Issue with detailed proposal
- Extended discussion period (minimum 14 days)
- Unanimous consensus among XSigmaAnalyitix maintainers required
- Community input strongly considered but not binding
- **XSigmaAnalyitix retains ultimate authority** over critical decisions
- Final decision documented in issue and announced to community

### Voting (When Maintainer Consensus Cannot Be Reached)

If consensus among maintainers cannot be reached after good-faith discussion:

1. **Maintainer Vote**: XSigmaAnalyitix maintainers vote on the proposal
2. **Majority Rule**: Simple majority (>50%) of maintainers required for approval
3. **Tie-Breaking**: In case of a tie, XSigmaAnalyitix leadership makes final decision
4. **Documentation**: Decision and rationale documented in the issue

**Note**: Community members do not vote on project decisions. Only XSigmaAnalyitix maintainers have voting rights.
