 * @brief Converts complete TraceMe events to XPlane format.
 *
 * This function takes a collection of TraceMe events from the traceme_recorder
 * and converts them into the XPlane format for visualization and analysis.
 * It handles:
 * - Event filtering (incomplete events, events before start time)
 * - Annotation parsing for metadata extraction
 * - Display name generation
 * - Event metadata and statistics
 * - Line sorting
 *
 * @param start_timestamp_ns The start timestamp in nanoseconds (events before this are filtered)
 * @param events The collection of TraceMe events to convert (moved)
 * @param raw_plane The XPlane to populate with converted events
