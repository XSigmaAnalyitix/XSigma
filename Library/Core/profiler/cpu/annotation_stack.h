 * @brief Backend for scoped annotations with hierarchical tracking.
 *
 * This class provides a thread-local stack of annotations that can be
 * pushed and popped to create hierarchical profiling scopes. Annotations
 * are concatenated with "::" separator to form a full scope path.
 *
 * **Thread Safety**: Each thread has its own annotation stack (thread-local).
 * The enable/disable state is global and atomic.
 *
 * **Example**:
 * ```cpp
 * annotation_stack::push_annotation("outer");
 * // Stack: "outer"
 * annotation_stack::push_annotation("inner");
 * // Stack: "outer::inner"
 * annotation_stack::pop_annotation();
 * // Stack: "outer"
 * annotation_stack::pop_annotation();
 * // Stack: ""
 * ```
