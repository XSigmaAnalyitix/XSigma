 * @brief Decorator for XSigma profiler plugins (REQUIRED COMPONENT)
 *
 * Tracks that calls to the underlying profiler interface functions are made
 * in the expected order: start, stop and collect_data. Making the calls
 * in a different order causes them to be aborted.
 *
 * Calls made in the right order will be aborted if one of the calls to the
 * decorated profiler interface fails, and no more calls will be forwarded to
 * the decorated profiler.
 *
 * COMPONENT CLASSIFICATION: REQUIRED
 * This is a core component essential for profiler lifecycle management.
