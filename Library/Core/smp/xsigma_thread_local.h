 * @class   xsigma_thread_local
 * @brief   Thread local storage for XSIGMA objects.
 *
 * A thread local object is one that maintains a copy of an object of the
 * template type for each thread that processes data. xsigma_thread_local
 * creates storage for all threads but the actual objects are created
 * the first time Local() is called. Note that some of the xsigma_thread_local
 * API is not thread safe. It can be safely used in a multi-threaded
 * environment because Local() returns storage specific to a particular
 * thread, which by default will be accessed sequentially. It is also
 * thread-safe to iterate over xsigma_thread_local as long as each thread
 * creates its own iterator and does not change any of the thread local
 * objects.
 *
 * A common design pattern in using a thread local storage object is to
 * write/accumulate data to local object when executing in parallel and
 * then having a sequential code block that iterates over the whole storage
 * using the iterators to do the final accumulation.
 *
 * @warning
 * There is absolutely no guarantee to the order in which the local objects
 * will be stored and hence the order in which they will be traversed when
 * using iterators. You should not even assume that two xsigma_thread_local
 * populated in the same parallel section will be populated in the same
 * order. For example, consider the following
 *
 * @code
 * xsigma_thread_local<int> Foo;
 * xsigma_thread_local<int> Bar;
 * class AFunctor
 * {
 *    void Initialize() const
 *    {
 *        int& foo = Foo.Local();
 *        int& bar = Bar.Local();
 *        foo = random();
 *        bar = foo;
 *    }
 *
 *    void operator()(int, int) const
 *    {}
 * };
 *
 * AFunctor functor;
 * xsigmaParalllelUtilities::For(0, 100000, functor);
 *
 * xsigma_thread_local<int>::iterator itr1 = Foo.begin();
 * xsigma_thread_local<int>::iterator itr2 = Bar.begin();
 * while (itr1 != Foo.end())
 * {
 *   assert(*itr1 == *itr2);
 *   ++itr1; ++itr2;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @warning
 * It is possible and likely that the assert() will fail using the TBB
 * backend. So if you need to store values related to each other and
 * iterate over them together, use a struct or class to group them together
 * and use a thread local of that class.
