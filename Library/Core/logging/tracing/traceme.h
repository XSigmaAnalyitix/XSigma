/**
 * @brief High-performance RAII-based CPU activity tracing for profiling and performance analysis.
 *
 * The `traceme` class provides a lightweight, thread-safe mechanism for instrumenting code
 * with timing and contextual information. It's designed for minimal overhead when tracing
 * is disabled and efficient event collection when enabled.
 *
 * **Key Features**:
 * - **RAII Design**: Automatic start/stop timing with scope-based lifetime management
 * - **Zero-Cost When Disabled**: Compile-time and runtime optimizations eliminate overhead
 * - **Thread-Safe**: Safe for concurrent use across multiple threads
 * - **Hierarchical Levels**: Support for filtering events by importance/verbosity
 * - **Rich Metadata**: Extensible metadata encoding for detailed analysis
 * - **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
 *
 * **Primary Use Cases**:
 * - Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
 * - Understanding CPU/GPU operation correlation and synchronization
 * - Debugging complex multi-threaded execution flows
 * - Memory allocation and computational operation tracing
 * - Integration with external profiling tools and visualizers
 *
 * **Two Usage Patterns**:
 *
 * 1. **Scoped RAII Objects** (Recommended):
 * ```cpp
 * {
 *     traceme trace("matrix_multiplication");
 *     // ... perform matrix multiplication ...
 * } // Automatically records timing when trace goes out of scope
 * ```
 *
 * 2. **Manual Activity Management**:
 * ```cpp
 * auto id = traceme::activity_start("async_operation");
 * // ... start asynchronous work ...
 * traceme::activity_end(id); // Must be called from same thread
 * ```
 *
 * **Performance Characteristics**:
 * - Overhead when disabled: ~1-2 CPU cycles (branch prediction + atomic load)
 * - Overhead when enabled: ~50-100 nanoseconds per trace event
 * - Memory usage: ~64 bytes per active trace event
 * - Thread contention: Lock-free recording minimizes blocking
 *
 * @note This class is optimized for high-frequency usage in performance-critical code.
 *       Events are recorded to thread-local buffers and collected during profiling sessions.

     *             Should be descriptive but concise for profiler display. Avoid dynamic

     * @param level Trace priority level for filtering (default: 1). Higher levels capture
     *              more detailed events but may impact performance:
     *              - 1 (CRITICAL): User operations, major computational steps
