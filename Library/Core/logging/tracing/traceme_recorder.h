/**
 * @brief High-performance, thread-safe singleton for collecting and managing trace events.
 *
 * The `traceme_recorder` serves as the central repository for all trace events generated
 * by `traceme` objects throughout the application. It's designed for minimal overhead
 * during event recording and efficient batch collection during profiling sessions.
 *
 * **Architecture**:
 * - **Singleton Pattern**: Global state accessible from any thread
 * - **Thread-Local Storage**: Each thread maintains independent event buffers
 * - **Lock-Free Recording**: Events are recorded without blocking other threads
 * - **Batch Collection**: Events are collected and processed in batches for efficiency
 *
 * **Lifecycle**:
 * 1. `start(level)` - Begins recording events at or below the specified level
 * 2. `record(event)` - Called by traceme objects to record individual events
 * 3. `stop()` - Ends recording and returns all collected events
 *
 * **Event Processing**:
 * - Complete events (with start and end times) are recorded directly
 * - Split events (activity_start/activity_end pairs) are matched and merged
 * - Cross-thread event correlation is handled automatically
 * - Unpaired events are discarded to maintain data integrity
 *
 * **Performance Characteristics**:
 * - Recording overhead: ~10-20 nanoseconds per event
 * - Memory usage: ~64 bytes per recorded event
 * - Thread contention: Minimal due to thread-local buffers
 * - Collection time: Proportional to number of events and threads
 *
 * **Thread Safety**: All methods are thread-safe. Recording can occur concurrently
 * with start/stop operations, though events recorded during stop may be discarded.
