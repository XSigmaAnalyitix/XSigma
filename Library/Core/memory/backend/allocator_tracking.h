/**
 * @brief Comprehensive memory allocation tracking and debugging wrapper.
 *
 * allocator_tracking provides sophisticated memory allocation tracking and
 * debugging capabilities by wrapping any underlying Allocator. It maintains
 * detailed statistics, allocation records, and provides advanced debugging
 * features for memory usage analysis.
 *
 * **Key Features**:
 * - Comprehensive allocation tracking and statistics
 * - High watermark monitoring for peak memory usage
 * - Detailed allocation records with timestamps
 * - Reference counting for safe wrapper lifecycle management
 * - Optional local size tracking for non-tracking allocators
 * - Thread-safe operation with fine-grained locking
 *
 * **Design Principles**:
 * - Decorator pattern wrapping underlying allocator
 * - Minimal performance overhead when tracking disabled
 * - Comprehensive debugging information when enabled
 * - Safe lifecycle management with reference counting
 * - Integration with XSigma execution framework
 *
 * **Use Cases**:
 * - Operation-specific memory usage tracking
 * - Memory leak detection and debugging
 * - Performance profiling and optimization
 * - Resource usage monitoring in production
 * - Development and testing environments
 *
 * **Thread Safety**: Fully thread-safe with internal mutex protection
 * **Performance**: Minimal overhead - delegates to underlying allocator
 * **Memory Overhead**: Small fixed overhead plus tracking data structures
 *
 * **Lifecycle Management**:
 * The allocator_tracking uses reference counting to manage its lifecycle safely.
 * It assumes that all allocations by an operation occur before the operation's
 * Compute method returns, establishing the high watermark. Deallocations can
 * occur long after operation completion, and the wrapper automatically deletes
 * itself when the last reference is released and all memory is deallocated.
