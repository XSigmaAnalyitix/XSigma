/**
 * @brief Low-level memory allocator interface for high-level allocator backends.
 *
 * sub_allocator provides the underlying memory allocation/deallocation services
 * for higher-level allocators like allocator_bfc. It's designed for infrequent
 * large allocations that are then managed by sophisticated pooling and caching
 * strategies in the higher-level allocator.
 *
 * **Design Principle**: Coarse-grained allocation with visitor pattern for monitoring
 * **Performance**: Optimized for large, infrequent allocations (not per-object allocation)
 * **Thread Safety**: Implementation-dependent, but typically thread-safe
 *
 * **Typical Usage Pattern**:
 * 1. Higher-level allocator requests large memory regions from sub_allocator
 * 2. Higher-level allocator subdivides regions for individual allocations
 * 3. sub_allocator is called infrequently compared to user allocation requests
 *
 * **Example**:
 * ```cpp
 * // allocator_bfc might request 64MB from sub_allocator
 * size_t received;
 * void* region = sub_alloc->Alloc(64, 64*1024*1024, &received);
 * // Then serve thousands of small allocations from this region
