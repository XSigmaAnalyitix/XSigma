 * @brief Platform abstraction layer for memory management and system information.
 *
 * The port namespace provides cross-platform abstractions for memory allocation,
 * system information retrieval, and platform-specific optimizations. It serves
 * as the foundation for higher-level memory management systems in XSigma.
 *
 * **Key Features**:
 * - Cross-platform aligned memory allocation
 * - System memory information and monitoring
 * - Memory bandwidth analysis
 * - Platform-specific optimizations
 * - NUMA awareness and affinity control
 *
 * **Design Principles**:
 * - Platform abstraction with consistent interface
 * - High-performance memory operations
 * - Comprehensive system information access
 * - Integration with system memory managers
 * - Support for specialized hardware configurations
