/**
 * @file thread_pool.h
 * @brief Thread Pool Implementation for XSigma Parallel Execution
 *
 * This file provides thread pool implementations used by the XSigma parallel module
 * for both intra-op and inter-op parallelism. The thread pool is used by the native
 * backend (when OpenMP is not available) to execute parallel tasks.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 * =============
 * The thread pool architecture consists of three main classes:
 *
 * 1. task_thread_pool_base (Abstract Base Class):
 *    - Defines the interface for all thread pools
 *    - Provides virtual methods for task submission and queries
 *    - Used for polymorphic thread pool management
 *
 * 2. thread_pool (Concrete Implementation):
 *    - Implements the core thread pool functionality
 *    - Manages worker threads, task queue, and synchronization
 *    - Uses mutex and condition variables for thread coordination
 *    - Supports both simple tasks and tasks with thread ID parameter
 *
 * 3. task_thread_pool (Specialized Thread Pool):
 *    - Extends thread_pool with NUMA awareness and thread naming
 *    - Sets thread names for debugging ("XsigmaTaskThread")
 *    - Optionally binds threads to NUMA nodes for performance
 *
 * DESIGN PATTERNS:
 * ================
 * - Producer-Consumer: Main thread produces tasks, worker threads consume
 * - RAII: Thread pool manages thread lifetime automatically
 * - Registry Pattern: ThreadPoolRegistry manages pool instances
 * - Virtual Interface: Polymorphic access via task_thread_pool_base
 *
 * SYNCHRONIZATION:
 * ================
 * - Task Queue: Protected by mutex, accessed via condition variable
 * - Completion Tracking: Uses atomic counter and condition variable
 * - Thread Safety: All public methods are thread-safe
 * - Memory Ordering: Uses standard mutex/condition_variable semantics
 *
 * THREAD LIFECYCLE:
 * =================
 * 1. Construction: Creates worker threads, starts main_loop
 * 2. Task Submission: Tasks added to queue, condition variable signaled
 * 3. Task Execution: Worker threads dequeue and execute tasks
 * 4. Completion Wait: wait_work_complete() blocks until queue is empty
 * 5. Destruction: Sets running_ = false, joins all worker threads
 *
 * CODING STANDARDS:
 * =================
 * - Follows XSigma C++ coding standards
 * - snake_case naming convention
 * - RAII for resource management (threads, mutexes)
 * - No exceptions in destructors
 * - Proper use of const and noexcept
 *
 * USAGE:
 * ======
 * The thread pool is typically accessed via ThreadPoolRegistry, not directly:
 * @code
 * auto pool = ThreadPoolRegistry()->run("MyPool", device_id, pool_size, true);
 * pool->run([]() { do_work(); });
 * @endcode
 *
 * For the native parallel backend, the thread pool is used internally by
 * invoke_parallel() in parallel.cxx.
