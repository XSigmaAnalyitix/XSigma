## Actions Taken

All broken links have been commented out using HTML comment syntax:
```html
<!-- [Link Text](broken-path.md) - Reason for being broken -->
```

This preserves the link information for future reference while preventing broken links from appearing in rendered documentation.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Create CI/CD Documentation**: If CI/CD documentation is planned, create the `Docs/ci/` directory and add the missing files.
2. **Remove References**: If CI/CD documentation is not planned, the commented-out links can be safely removed.
3. **Link Verification**: All other links in the documentation have been verified and are working correctly.

---

## Verification Results

✓ All links in README.md verified (16 valid links, 2 broken links commented out)  
✓ All internal links in Docs/readme/ files verified (all valid except 1 broken link commented out)  
✓ No other broken links found in the documentation
