## ❓ Quick Answers to Common Questions

### Q: Should we enable LTO?
**A**: ✅ Yes, keep it enabled for Release builds  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md → Recommendations

### Q: Why is linking slow with LTO?
**A**: LTO performs full program optimization during linking (20-50% overhead)  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_ANALYSIS.md → Disadvantages

### Q: How much performance improvement do we get?
**A**: 5-15% runtime improvement, 5-10% binary size reduction  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_ANALYSIS.md → Advantages

### Q: Why are faster linkers disabled with LTO?
**A**: LTO + gold/mold linkers cause out-of-memory errors  
**Reference**: LTO_TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md → Troubleshooting

### Q: Can we use LTO with coverage analysis?
**A**: ❌ No, LTO is incompatible with coverage instrumentation  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_ANALYSIS.md → Build Configuration Interactions

### Q: What about Windows DLL compatibility?
**A**: ⚠️ Supported but limited CI testing; needs improvement  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_ANALYSIS.md → Shared Library Complications

### Q: How do I disable LTO for development?
**A**: Use debug build: `python setup.py config.build.test.ninja.clang.debug`  
**Reference**: LTO_RECOMMENDATIONS_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md → Developer Workflow

### Q: What's the memory impact?
**A**: 2-4x higher memory usage during linking (known issue, mitigated)  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_ANALYSIS.md → Memory Usage During Linking

### Q: Is LTO supported on all platforms?
**A**: ✅ Yes, all XSigma-supported compilers have mature LTO support  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_ANALYSIS.md → Compiler Support

### Q: What about debugging with LTO?
**A**: ⚠️ Difficult; use RelWithDebInfo builds without LTO  
**Reference**: LTO_INVESTIGATION_ANALYSIS.md → Debugging Difficulties
