## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the XSigma project against the [OpenSSF Best Practices criteria](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/criteria). XSigma demonstrates **strong compliance** with most passing-level requirements, with particular strengths in:

- ✅ **Security practices** (dedicated Security module, SECURITY.md policy)
- ✅ **Quality assurance** (comprehensive testing, 98% coverage target, static analysis)
- ✅ **Build system** (modern CMake, cross-platform, automated CI/CD)
- ✅ **Documentation** (extensive README, guides, API docs)

**Overall Assessment**: **~85% compliant** with passing-level criteria. Key gaps are in formal release management and contributor documentation.
