## Quick Reference

### Issue Severity Levels

| Severity | Symbol | Count | Description |
|----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Critical | 🔴 | 0 | Security vulnerabilities, data loss, blocking bugs |
| High | 🟠 | 3 | Major functionality issues, compatibility blockers |
| Medium | 🟡 | 8 | Code quality, maintainability, minor bugs |
| Low | 🟢 | 12 | Style issues, minor improvements |

### Top 3 High Priority Issues

1. **H1: Windows Compatibility - grep_linter.py**
   - **Impact:** Blocks Windows users from using pattern-based linters
   - **Effort:** 1-2 days
   - **Solution:** Implement pure Python fallback for grep/sed

2. **H2: Hardcoded Path Case Issue**
   - **Impact:** Fails on case-sensitive filesystems
   - **Effort:** 15 minutes
   - **Solution:** Fix path case in codespell_linter.py

3. **H3: Missing Windows Detection**
   - **Impact:** Potential path and shell execution issues on Windows
   - **Effort:** 1 day
   - **Solution:** Add IS_WINDOWS checks to all adapters

### Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Python Linters | C++ Linters | Build Linters | Config Linters | Pattern Linters |

2. ✅ Consistent JSON protocol (LintMessage)
3. ✅ Robust error handling throughout
4. ✅ Parallel execution with concurrent.futures
5. ✅ Security best practices (SHA256 verification, version pinning)
6. ✅ Good cross-platform foundation (pathlib, Windows detection)
7. ✅ Comprehensive configuration system
8. ✅ Excellent documentation (750+ lines in linter.md)
9. ✅ Type hints and modern Python features
10. ✅ Consistent logging and debugging support

### Areas for Improvement

1. ⚠️ Windows compatibility for grep-based linters
2. ⚠️ Code duplication in run_command functions
3. ⚠️ Inconsistent error message formatting
4. ⚠️ Missing type hints in some functions
5. ⚠️ Race condition in clangtidy_linter.py
