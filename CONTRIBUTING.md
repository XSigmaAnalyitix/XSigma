## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [conduct@xsigma.co.uk](mailto:conduct@xsigma.co.uk).

## Contribution Policy and Control

### Welcome and Acceptance Policy

**XSigma welcomes contributions from the community**, and we are grateful for your interest in improving the project. However, it is important to understand the contribution acceptance policy and control structure:

#### XSigmaAnalyitix Authority

- **All contributions are subject to review and approval** by XSigmaAnalyitix maintainers
- **XSigmaAnalyitix retains full control** over what code is accepted into the project
- **Final decision authority** on all technical, architectural, and strategic matters rests with XSigmaAnalyitix
- **XSigmaAnalyitix reserves the right** to refuse contributions that don't align with:
  - Project goals and strategic direction
  - Quality standards and coding conventions
  - Architectural vision and design principles
  - Security and performance requirements
  - Legal and licensing requirements

#### Contribution Rights Grant

By submitting a contribution to XSigma, you grant XSigmaAnalyitix the right to:

- **Use, modify, or reject** your contribution at their sole discretion
- **Incorporate** your contribution into the XSigma codebase
- **Relicense** your contribution under commercial licenses without additional permission
- **Modify or remove** your contribution in future versions
- **Distribute** your contribution as part of XSigma under both GPL-3.0-or-later and commercial licenses

#### Dual Licensing and Commercial Use

XSigma operates under a **dual licensing model**:

- **GPL-3.0-or-later**: The public receives the software under GPL-3.0-or-later terms
- **Commercial License**: XSigmaAnalyitix offers commercial licenses for proprietary use

**By contributing, you explicitly grant XSigmaAnalyitix the ability to offer commercial licenses** for the combined work (including your contributions) **without seeking additional permission or providing compensation**.

This dual licensing model is essential to XSigma's sustainability and allows XSigmaAnalyitix to:
- Fund ongoing development and maintenance
- Provide commercial support and services
- Offer proprietary licensing options to customers who cannot use GPL-3.0

#### No Guarantee of Acceptance

- **Submission does not guarantee acceptance** - XSigmaAnalyitix may reject contributions for any reason
- **Maintainers have sole discretion** over merge decisions
- **Community input is valued** but does not override maintainer decisions
- **Rejected contributions** may be reconsidered if revised to meet project requirements

#### Project Control and Roadmap

- **XSigmaAnalyitix controls the project roadmap**, feature priorities, and release schedule
- **Architectural decisions** are made by XSigmaAnalyitix maintainers
- **Breaking changes** and major refactoring are at XSigmaAnalyitix's discretion
- **Community suggestions** are welcome but not binding

### Why This Model?

This contribution model ensures:

- **Consistent quality** and architectural coherence
- **Legal clarity** for dual licensing
- **Sustainable development** through commercial licensing revenue
- **Clear decision-making** authority
- **Protection** of XSigmaAnalyitix's business interests

We believe this model balances **open-source collaboration** with the **business sustainability** necessary for long-term project success.

## Contribution Rights and Ownership

## Coding Standards

XSigma follows strict coding standards to ensure code quality, consistency, and maintainability. All contributions must adhere to these standards.

### Core Principles

- **No exceptions**: Use return values (`bool`, `std::optional<T>`, `std::expected<T, E>`) for error handling
- **RAII**: All resources must be managed using RAII principles
- **Smart pointers**: Use `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` instead of raw pointers for ownership
- **Const correctness**: Mark all non-mutating methods and variables as `const`

### Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Class | `snake_case` | `class my_class` |
| Function | `snake_case` | `void do_something()` |
| Member Variable | `snake_case_` (trailing underscore) | `int count_;` |
| Local Variable | `snake_case` | `int local_value` |
| Constant | `kConstantName` | `const int kMaxCount = 100;` |
| Namespace | `snake_case` | `namespace xsigma` |
| Enum | `snake_case` | `enum class color_type` |
| Enum Value | `snake_case` | `color_type::dark_red` |

### Code Formatting

- **Automatic formatting**: Use `clang-format` (configuration in `.clang-format`)
- **Line length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Brace style**: Allman style (opening brace on same line)

**Format your code before committing**:
```bash
cd Tools/linter
python -m lintrunner --fix
```

### Static Analysis

All code must pass static analysis checks:

```bash
cd Scripts

# Run clang-tidy
python setup.py config.build.ninja.clang.clangtidy

# Run cppcheck
python setup.py config.build.ninja.clang.cppcheck

# Run IWYU (Include-What-You-Use)
python setup.py config.build.ninja.clang.iwyu
```

### Include Paths

- Include paths must start from the project subfolder, not the repository root
- Do **not** use absolute paths or paths starting with `Core/`

**Example**: For file `Core/xxx/yyy/a.h`:
```cpp
// ❌ Incorrect
#include "Core/xxx/yyy/a.h"

// ✅ Correct
#include "xxx/yyy/a.h"
```

### DLL Export Macros

Apply these macros for correct symbol visibility:

- **Functions**: Use `XSIGMA_API` before function return type
- **Classes**: Use `XSIGMA_VISIBILITY` before `class` keyword

```cpp
class XSIGMA_VISIBILITY my_class {
 public:
  XSIGMA_API void do_something();
};
```

### Detailed Standards

For complete coding standards, see [`.augment/rules/coding.md`](.augment/rules/coding.md).


## Testing Requirements

### Coverage and Quality

- **MANDATORY**: Minimum **98% code coverage** required
- Tests must be deterministic, reproducible, and isolated
- Use the `XSIGMATEST` macro exclusively (not `TEST` or `TEST_F`)

### Test File Naming

- Test files must mirror source file hierarchy
- Use naming pattern `Test[ClassName].cpp` (CamelCase for test files only)
- Place test files in the same directory structure under `Tests/` subdirectory

### Test Scope

- Test happy paths and success cases
- Explicitly test boundary conditions and edge cases
- Test error handling and failure scenarios
- Test null pointers, empty collections, and invalid inputs
- Verify state changes and side effects

### Writing Tests

Example:
```cpp
XSIGMATEST(my_class_test, handles_valid_input) {
  my_class obj;
  EXPECT_TRUE(obj.do_something());
}

XSIGMATEST(my_class_test, handles_invalid_input) {
  my_class obj;
  EXPECT_FALSE(obj.do_something_with(-1));
}

XSIGMATEST(my_class_test, handles_null_pointer) {
  my_class obj;
  EXPECT_FALSE(obj.process(nullptr));
}

XSIGMATEST(my_class_test, handles_empty_collection) {
  my_class obj;
  std::vector<int> empty;
  EXPECT_TRUE(obj.process_collection(empty));
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd Scripts
python setup.py config.build.test.ninja.clang.debug
cd ../build_ninja_debug
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Coverage Reports

```bash
cd Scripts
python setup.py config.build.test.ninja.clang.coverage
cd ../build_ninja_coverage
ctest
# Coverage report generated in coverage/ directory
```
