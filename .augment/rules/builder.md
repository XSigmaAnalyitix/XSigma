# ✅ Augment Rule: `builder_convention_rule`

**Description**  
Enforces best practices and conventions for builder classes (`xxx_builder`) to ensure consistency, readability, and correctness within the `xsigma` framework.

---

## 🎯 Targets

- **Class names** ending with `_builder`

---

## 📏 Rule Checks

### 🔹 Class Naming
- **Must** end with `_builder`  
  💬 _"Builder class name must end with `_builder`."_

---

### 🔹 Member Variables
- **Preferred**: Include `ptr_mutable<xxx>`  
  💬 _"Prefer using `ptr_mutable<xxx>` to hold the object under construction."_

---

### 🔹 Methods

#### ✔ Naming
- **Must** start with `with_` followed by the variable name  
  💬 _"Setter methods must follow the `with_<field>` naming convention."_

#### ✔ Parameters
- **Must** accept exactly one parameter  
  💬 _"Each setter method must accept exactly one parameter."_

#### ✔ Return Type
- **Must** start with `xsigma::`  
  💬 _"Setter methods must return a type starting with `xsigma::` to support fluent builder chaining."_

#### ✔ Comments
- **Must** include descriptive comments  
  💬 _"Each method must have a descriptive comment explaining its purpose."_

---

### 🔹 Class-Level Comment
- **Must** include a top-level comment  
  💬 _"The builder class must include a class-level comment describing its role."_
