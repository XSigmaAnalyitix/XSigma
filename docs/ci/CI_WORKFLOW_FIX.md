# CI Workflow Fix - Job Dependencies

## Problem

The CI workflow was failing with "No jobs were run" because the `ci-success` job was referencing a non-existent job dependency:

- **Old reference**: `compiler-version-tests` (singular)
- **Actual jobs**: `compiler-version-tests-clang` and `compiler-version-tests-gcc` (plural)

This caused GitHub Actions to fail to initialize the workflow because the dependency chain was broken.

## Root Cause

When the compiler version testing jobs were split into separate Clang and GCC jobs, the `ci-success` job's dependency list was not updated to reflect the new job names.

## Solution

Updated the `ci-success` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to reference the correct job names:

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `needs` section** (lines 1840-1850):
   - Removed: `compiler-version-tests`
   - Added: `compiler-version-tests-clang`
   - Added: `compiler-version-tests-gcc`

2. **Updated echo statements** (lines 1859-1860):
   - Changed: `Compiler Version Tests: ${{ needs.compiler-version-tests.result }}`
   - To: `Compiler Version Tests (Clang): ${{ needs.compiler-version-tests-clang.result }}`
   - To: `Compiler Version Tests (GCC): ${{ needs.compiler-version-tests-gcc.result }}`

3. **Updated error checking** (lines 1876-1884):
   - Added separate checks for both Clang and GCC compiler tests
   - Each now reports specific errors for its respective job

4. **Updated documentation comments** (lines 1919-1992):
   - Updated job structure overview
   - Updated compiler version matrix testing documentation
   - Clarified that each job installs only one compiler version

## Verification

✅ **YAML Syntax**: Valid (verified with Python YAML parser)
✅ **Job Dependencies**: All 10 dependencies exist and are correctly referenced
✅ **Job List**:
   - build-matrix ✓
   - compiler-version-tests-clang ✓
   - compiler-version-tests-gcc ✓
   - tbb-specific-tests ✓
   - sanitizer-tests ✓
   - optimization-flags-test ✓
   - lto-tests ✓
   - benchmark-tests ✓
   - sccache-baseline-tests ✓
   - sccache-enabled-tests ✓
   - ci-success ✓

## Impact

- ✅ CI workflow will now initialize correctly
- ✅ All 30 compiler version testing jobs will run (12 Clang + 18 GCC)
- ✅ `ci-success` job will properly aggregate results from all jobs
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (4 sections updated)

## Next Steps

1. Push changes to repository
2. Trigger CI workflow (push to main/develop or use workflow_dispatch)
3. Verify all jobs run successfully
4. Monitor for any build failures
