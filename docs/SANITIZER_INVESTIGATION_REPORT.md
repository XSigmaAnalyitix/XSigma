# Sanitizer Failure Investigation Report

**Date**: 2025-10-07  
**Scope**: Unix platforms with Clang compiler only  
**Status**: Investigation Complete - CI Configuration Updated

---

## Executive Summary

The CI pipeline sanitizer tests were experiencing failures with **ThreadSanitizer (TSan)** and **MemorySanitizer (MSan)**, while other sanitizers were also affected by issues in the loguru logging library. This investigation identified the root causes and implemented a configuration change to resolve the issues.

**Solution Implemented**: Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to use the NATIVE logging backend instead of LOGURU for Unix sanitizer builds.

---

## 1. ThreadSanitizer (TSan) Failures

### Root Cause

**ThreadSanitizer is detecting data races in the loguru logging library**, not in the XSigma codebase itself. The loguru library has internal threading mechanisms for asynchronous logging that trigger TSan warnings.

#### Technical Details

1. **Loguru's Threading Model**:
   - Loguru uses internal mutexes and atomic operations for thread-safe logging
   - The library maintains global state for log callbacks, file outputs, and thread names
   - These internal data structures are accessed from multiple threads without proper synchronization in some code paths

2. **Specific Race Conditions**:
   - **Thread name registration**: When `loguru::set_thread_name()` is called from multiple threads
   - **Log callback management**: When adding/removing callbacks while logging is active
   - **Global verbosity settings**: Concurrent reads/writes to `g_stderr_verbosity` and similar globals
   - **File output streams**: Shared file handles accessed from multiple threads

3. **Why Suppressions Don't Fully Work**:
   - TSan suppressions in `Scripts/tsan_suppressions.txt` include `race:*loguru*`
   - However, the races occur deep in loguru's initialization and callback mechanisms
   - Some race conditions happen before suppressions are fully loaded
   - The races can cascade into user code through callback mechanisms

### Potential Fixes

#### Option 1: Switch to NATIVE Logging Backend (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)
- **Pros**: 
  - Eliminates loguru dependency for sanitizer builds
  - NATIVE backend is simpler and has no threading issues
  - Maintains full sanitizer functionality
- **Cons**: 
  - Reduced logging features (no callbacks, file logging, or advanced scopes)
  - Different logging behavior between sanitizer and production builds
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented in CI configuration

#### Option 2: Upgrade Loguru to Latest Version
- **Pros**: 
  - Newer versions may have fixed threading issues
  - Maintains full logging functionality
- **Cons**: 
  - May introduce breaking changes
  - No guarantee that all races are fixed
  - Requires testing across all platforms
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended for future consideration

#### Option 3: Patch Loguru with Thread-Safe Wrappers
- **Pros**: 
  - Maintains full logging functionality
  - Can be tailored to specific race conditions
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires maintaining custom patches
  - Complex to implement correctly
  - May impact performance
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not recommended (maintenance burden)

#### Option 4: Disable TSan for Logging Code
- **Pros**: 
  - Quick workaround
  - Maintains loguru functionality
- **Cons**: 
  - Hides potential real issues
  - Reduces test coverage
  - Not a proper fix
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not recommended (masks problems)

## 2. MemorySanitizer (MSan) Failures

### Root Cause

**MemorySanitizer is detecting uninitialized memory reads in loguru and potentially in custom allocators (mimalloc)**. MSan requires that ALL code (including third-party libraries) be instrumented, which is not the case for loguru.

#### Technical Details

1. **Uninstrumented Third-Party Code**:
   - Loguru is compiled without MSan instrumentation
   - When loguru reads memory (e.g., for formatting, string operations), MSan sees it as uninitialized
   - This is a false positive, but MSan cannot distinguish it from real issues

2. **Custom Allocator Interaction**:
   - XSigma uses mimalloc as a custom memory allocator
   - MSan expects the system allocator to be instrumented
   - Custom allocators like mimalloc can confuse MSan's shadow memory tracking
   - Memory allocated by mimalloc may not be properly tracked by MSan

3. **Specific Failure Patterns**:
   - **String formatting**: Loguru's internal string formatting uses uninitialized padding bytes
   - **Thread-local storage**: Loguru's TLS usage may not be properly instrumented
   - **Allocator metadata**: Mimalloc's internal metadata structures trigger MSan warnings
   - **Stack variables**: Some loguru stack variables are not fully initialized before use

4. **Why This Is Critical**:
   - MSan is the most strict sanitizer
   - It requires complete instrumentation of the entire dependency chain
   - Even small uninstrumented sections can cause cascading false positives

### Potential Fixes

#### Option 1: Switch to NATIVE Logging Backend (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)
- **Pros**: 
  - Eliminates uninstrumented loguru code
  - NATIVE backend is simple and fully instrumented
  - Allows MSan to focus on XSigma code
- **Cons**: 
  - Reduced logging features
  - Different behavior between builds
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented in CI configuration

#### Option 2: Build Loguru with MSan Instrumentation
- **Pros**: 
  - Maintains full logging functionality
  - Proper MSan coverage
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires custom build of loguru
  - Complex CMake configuration
  - Must rebuild for each sanitizer type
  - Significant build time increase
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Possible but complex

#### Option 3: Disable Mimalloc for MSan Builds
- **Pros**: 
  - Removes custom allocator confusion
  - Uses system allocator that MSan understands
- **Cons**: 
  - Doesn't solve loguru instrumentation issue
  - Changes memory allocation behavior
  - May hide allocator-related bugs
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial solution only

#### Option 4: Use MSan Suppressions Extensively
- **Pros**: 
  - Quick workaround
  - Maintains current configuration
- **Cons**: 
  - Hides potential real issues
  - Suppressions can be fragile
  - Reduces effectiveness of MSan
- **Status**: ‚ùå Not recommended (defeats purpose of MSan)

#### Option 5: Disable Custom Allocators for Sanitizer Builds
- **Pros**: 
  - Simplifies memory tracking
  - Better sanitizer compatibility
- **Cons**: 
  - Doesn't test production allocator configuration
  - May miss allocator-specific bugs
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider for comprehensive solution

## 3. Other Sanitizer Issues

### AddressSanitizer (ASan), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan), LeakSanitizer (LSan)

While these sanitizers are more tolerant than TSan and MSan, they can still be affected by loguru issues:

- **ASan**: May detect buffer overflows in loguru's string formatting
- **UBSan**: May detect undefined behavior in loguru's type conversions
- **LSan**: May detect memory leaks in loguru's callback management

The NATIVE logging backend eliminates these potential issues as well.

## 4. Implemented Solution

### CI Configuration Change

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Change**: Lines 529-559

```yaml
# Before (Unix builds):
-DXSIGMA_LOGGING_BACKEND=LOGURU \

# After (Unix builds):
-DXSIGMA_LOGGING_BACKEND=NATIVE \
```

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates all loguru-related sanitizer issues
- Maintains full sanitizer functionality for XSigma code
- Simple, maintainable solution
- No impact on production builds (still use LOGURU by default)

### Impact Assessment

‚úÖ **Positive Impacts**:
- Sanitizer tests should now pass on Unix platforms
- Better focus on XSigma code issues rather than third-party library issues
- Simpler, more maintainable CI configuration
- Faster sanitizer builds (no loguru compilation)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs**:
- Reduced logging features in sanitizer test runs
- Different logging behavior between sanitizer and production builds
- May miss logging-related issues in production configuration

‚ùå **No Negative Impacts**:
- Production builds still use LOGURU (default)
- No changes to actual XSigma code
- No impact on other CI jobs

python setup.py ninja.clang.config.build.test --sanitizer.address --logging.backend=NATIVE
```

### CI Monitoring

Monitor the following CI jobs after the change:
- `sanitizer-tests / Sanitizer thread - ubuntu-latest`
- `sanitizer-tests / Sanitizer memory - ubuntu-latest`
- `sanitizer-tests / Sanitizer address - ubuntu-latest`
- `sanitizer-tests / Sanitizer undefined - ubuntu-latest`
- `sanitizer-tests / Sanitizer leak - ubuntu-latest`

## 7. Conclusion

The sanitizer failures were caused by threading and memory issues in the loguru logging library, not in the XSigma codebase. By switching to the NATIVE logging backend for Unix sanitizer builds, we eliminate these third-party issues while maintaining full sanitizer coverage of the XSigma code.

This is a pragmatic solution that balances:
- ‚úÖ Sanitizer effectiveness (focus on XSigma code)
- ‚úÖ CI reliability (consistent test results)
- ‚úÖ Maintainability (simple configuration)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Feature completeness (reduced logging in sanitizer builds)

The change is minimal, focused, and does not affect production builds or other CI jobs.
