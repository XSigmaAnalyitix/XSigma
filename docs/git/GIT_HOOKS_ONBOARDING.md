# Git Hooks Onboarding Guide for New Developers

Welcome to the XSigma project! This guide will help you set up and understand the automated git hooks that maintain code quality.

---

## üéØ What You Need to Know

### The Basics

When you commit code to XSigma, two automated checks run:

1. **Code Formatting** - Your C++ files are automatically formatted to match project style
2. **Message Validation** - Your commit message is checked for quality and spelling

**Don't worry!** These hooks are helpful, not restrictive. They:
- ‚úÖ Save you time by auto-formatting code
- ‚úÖ Catch typos before they reach the repository
- ‚úÖ Ensure consistent code style across the team
- ‚úÖ Can be bypassed in emergencies

---

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install clang-format

**Windows (using Chocolatey):**
```powershell
choco install llvm
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install clang-format
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install clang-format
```

**Linux (RHEL/CentOS/Fedora):**
```bash
sudo yum install clang-tools-extra
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

```bash
clang-format --version
```

You should see something like: `clang-format version 21.1.2`

### Step 3: Install Git Hooks

```bash
cd Scripts
python setup_git_hooks.py --install
```

You should see:
```
‚úì Git hooks installed successfully!
```

### Step 4: Test It Works

```bash
python test_git_hooks.py
```

All tests should pass! ‚úÖ

## üí° Your First Commit with Hooks

Let's walk through what happens when you make your first commit:

### Example Scenario

```bash
# 1. You edit a file
vim Core/math/vector.cxx

# 2. You stage it
git add Core/math/vector.cxx

# 3. You commit
git commit -m "Add vector normalization function"
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

```
‚Ñπ Running XSigma pre-commit hook...
‚úì Found clang-format: clang-format
‚Ñπ Found 1 staged file(s)

‚Ñπ Formatting 1 C++ file(s)...
‚Ñπ Formatting: Core/math/vector.cxx

‚úì Formatted 1 file(s):
  - Core/math/vector.cxx

‚úì Pre-commit hook completed successfully!
‚Ñπ ‚úì Commit message validation passed

[main abc1234] Add vector normalization function
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
```

**What just happened:**
1. ‚úÖ Your file was automatically formatted to match project style
2. ‚úÖ The formatted file was re-staged
3. ‚úÖ Your commit message was validated
4. ‚úÖ Your commit succeeded!

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Commit Message Too Short

```bash
git commit -m "fix bug"
```

**Result:**
```
‚úó ERROR: Commit message validation failed:

  ‚Ä¢ Commit message is too short (7 characters). Minimum 10 characters required.

‚Ñπ Please fix the issues above and try again.
```

**Solution:**
```bash
git commit -m "Fix null pointer bug in vector class"
```

### Scenario 2: Spelling Mistake

```bash
git commit -m "Fix teh vector normalization bug"
```

**Result:**
```
‚úó ERROR: Commit message validation failed:

  ‚Ä¢ Spelling mistakes found: 'teh' -> 'the'

‚Ñπ Please fix the issues above and try again.
```

**Solution:**
```bash
git commit -m "Fix the vector normalization bug"
```

### Scenario 3: Placeholder Message

```bash
git commit -m "wip"
```

**Result:**
```
‚úó ERROR: Commit message validation failed:

  ‚Ä¢ Commit message appears to be a placeholder: 'wip'. Please provide a meaningful commit message.

‚Ñπ Please fix the issues above and try again.
```

**Solution:**
```bash
git commit -m "Work in progress: Implementing vector normalization"
```

### Scenario 4: Emergency Hotfix

Sometimes you need to commit quickly without running hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency: Fix production crash"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use sparingly!** Only for true emergencies.

## üìù Writing Good Commit Messages

### ‚úÖ Good Examples

```bash
# Clear and descriptive
git commit -m "Add matrix multiplication function"

# Explains what and why
git commit -m "Fix memory leak in vector destructor

The destructor was not properly releasing allocated memory
when the vector was destroyed. This fix ensures proper cleanup."

# References issue
git commit -m "Fix issue #123: Incorrect vector normalization

The normalization function was dividing by zero for null vectors.
Added check to return zero vector in this case."
```

### ‚ùå Bad Examples

```bash
# Too short
git commit -m "fix"

# Placeholder
git commit -m "wip"

# Not descriptive
git commit -m "update code"

# Spelling mistakes
git commit -m "Fix teh bug in teh vector class"
```

### Tips for Great Commit Messages

1. **Start with a verb:** "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove", "Refactor"
2. **Be specific:** What exactly did you change?
3. **Keep first line under 72 characters**
4. **Use proper spelling and grammar**
5. **Explain why, not just what** (in the body)

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Minimum Message Length

If you find the 10-character minimum too restrictive:

1. Open `.git/hooks/commit-msg`
2. Find this line:
   ```python
   MIN_COMMIT_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 10
   ```
3. Change to your preference (e.g., `15` or `20`)

### Adding Technical Terms to Ignore List

If the spell checker flags technical terms:

1. Open `.git/hooks/commit-msg`
2. Find the `IGNORE_WORDS` set
3. Add your terms:
   ```python
   IGNORE_WORDS = {
       'cpp', 'hpp', 'xsigma',
       'myterm',  # Add your term here
   }
   ```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "clang-format not found"

**Solution:**
1. Install clang-format (see Step 1 above)
2. Verify it's in your PATH:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   where clang-format
   
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   which clang-format
   ```
3. Restart your terminal

### Problem: "Hook not running"

**Solution:**
1. Check hook status:
   ```bash
   python Scripts/setup_git_hooks.py --status
   ```
2. Reinstall hooks:
   ```bash
   python Scripts/setup_git_hooks.py --install
   ```
3. On Unix/Linux/macOS, ensure executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
   ```

### Problem: "Python not found" (Windows)

**Solution:**
1. Ensure Python is installed (required for XSigma anyway)
2. Add Python to PATH
3. Restart terminal

### Problem: "Hook is too slow"

**Solution:**
For large commits, you can bypass hooks:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Large refactoring"
```

Then manually format:
```bash
clang-format -i path/to/file.cxx
```

---

## üéì Advanced Usage

### Amending Commits

Hooks run on amended commits too:

```bash
git commit --amend
```

The hooks will re-check everything.

### Interactive Staging

You can stage parts of files:

```bash
git add -p Core/math/vector.cxx
git commit -m "Add normalization function"
```

Only staged parts will be formatted.

### Checking Hook Status

```bash
python Scripts/setup_git_hooks.py --status
```

Shows:
- Which hooks are installed
- If clang-format is available
- Hook versions
