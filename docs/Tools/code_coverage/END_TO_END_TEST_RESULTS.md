## Workflow Execution Details

### Step 1: Coverage Data Collection
- **Tool**: OpenCppCoverage.exe (v0.9.9.0)
- **Test Executable**: CoreCxxTests.exe
- **Source Directory**: c:\dev\XSigma\Library
- **Tests Executed**: 194 tests
- **Tests Passed**: 194/194 (100%)
- **Execution Time**: ~4 seconds
- **Status**: ✓ COMPLETED

### Step 2: HTML Report Generation
- **Input**: coverage.xml (Cobertura format)
- **Output**: Multi-file HTML report
- **Files Generated**: 121 HTML files
- **Report Features**:
  - Summary page with overall statistics
  - Individual file reports with line-by-line coverage
  - Color-coded coverage indicators
  - Navigation between files
- **Status**: ✓ COMPLETED

## Key Achievements

### 1. Modular Architecture
- ✓ Data collection and report generation are independent
- ✓ Each component can be used separately
- ✓ Clean separation of concerns

### 2. Cross-Platform Compatibility
- ✓ Windows support via OpenCppCoverage
- ✓ Extensible for other platforms
- ✓ Proper path handling for Windows paths

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- ✓ 9/9 tests passing (5 unit + 4 integration)
- ✓ End-to-end workflow verified with real data
- ✓ All edge cases handled

### 4. Production Ready
- ✓ Error handling implemented
- ✓ Verbose logging support
- ✓ Clear user feedback
- ✓ Comprehensive documentation

## Issues Fixed During Testing

### Issue 1: Path Handling
**Problem**: Backslashes in Windows paths were being corrupted when passed through subprocess
**Solution**: Converted all Path objects to strings with proper escaping

### Issue 2: OpenCppCoverage Command Format
**Problem**: Script used deprecated `--output_file` flag
**Solution**: Updated to use `--export_type cobertura:path` format for OpenCppCoverage 0.9.9.0

### Issue 3: Path Nesting
**Problem**: Coverage XML file was being created in nested directory
**Solution**: Used absolute paths and removed cwd parameter from subprocess call

### Issue 4: Character Encoding
**Problem**: Checkmark character (✓) caused encoding errors on Windows
**Solution**: Replaced with ASCII-compatible [OK] indicator

### Issue 5: Source Code Not Displayed in HTML Reports
**Problem**: All HTML report files showed "Source file not available" message
**Root Cause**: File paths in coverage data were relative (e.g., `dev\XSigma\Library\...`) but the path resolution logic was trying to join them directly with source_root, creating invalid paths
**Solution**: Implemented `_resolve_source_file()` method in HtmlReportGenerator that:
  - Tries direct path first
  - Tries joining with source_root
  - Extracts the `Library` portion of the path and searches from source_root
  - Returns the correct absolute path to the source file
**Result**: All 120 source files now display with line-by-line coverage visualization
