# CMake Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the XSigma CMake build system to improve organization, maintainability, and prevent duplicate module inclusions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Feature Flags Moved to Respective Modules

All `XSIGMA_ENABLE_XXX` flags have been moved from the main `CMakeLists.txt` to their corresponding feature modules in `Cmake/tools/`:

| Flag | Module | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_CUDA` | `cuda.cmake` | GPU acceleration via NVIDIA CUDA |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_TBB` | `tbb.cmake` | Intel Threading Building Blocks |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_MKL` | `mkl.cmake` | Intel Math Kernel Library |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_NUMA` | `numa.cmake` | NUMA memory support (Unix only) |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_CLANGTIDY` | `clang_tidy.cmake` | Static code analysis |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_FIX` | `clang_tidy.cmake` | Automatic clang-tidy fixes |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_COVERAGE` | `coverage.cmake` | Code coverage instrumentation |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_VALGRIND` | `valgrind.cmake` | Memory checking with Valgrind |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_SANITIZER` | `sanitize.cmake` | Compiler sanitizers (ASan, UBSan, etc.) |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_IWYU` | `iwyu.cmake` | Include-What-You-Use analysis |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_SPELL` | `spell.cmake` | Spell checking with codespell |
| `XSIGMA_ENABLE_HIP` | `hip.cmake` | AMD GPU acceleration via HIP |

### 2. Include Guards Added to All Modules

All CMake module files now include `include_guard(GLOBAL)` to prevent multiple inclusions:

- `Cmake/tools/cache.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/clang_tidy.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/coverage.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/cuda.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/helper_macros.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/hip.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/iwyu.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/linker.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/mkl.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/numa.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/sanitize.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/spell.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/summary.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/tbb.cmake`
- `Cmake/tools/valgrind.cmake`

### 3. Main CMakeLists.txt Reorganization

The main `CMakeLists.txt` now has clearly organized sections with descriptive comments:

1. **General Project-Wide Configuration Flags**
   - `XSIGMA_ENABLE_ENZYME` (Enzyme automatic differentiation)
   - `XSIGMA_GPU_ALLOC` (GPU allocation strategy)

2. **Algorithm and Feature Configuration Flags**
   - `XSIGMA_SOBOL_1111` (Sobol sequence support)
   - `XSIGMA_LU_PIVOTING` (LU decomposition pivoting)

3. **Testing and Quality Assurance Configuration Flags**
   - `XSIGMA_BUILD_TESTING` (Test directory building)
   - `XSIGMA_ENABLE_BENCHMARK` (Google Benchmark)
   - `XSIGMA_ENABLE_GTEST` (Google Test)

4. **Performance and Optimization Configuration Flags**
   - `XSIGMA_VECTORIZATION_TYPE` (SIMD vectorization strategy)

5. **Third-Party Library and Dependency Configuration Flags**
   - `XSIGMA_ENABLE_EXTERNAL` (External library usage)
   - `XSIGMA_ENABLE_MAGICENUM` (Magic Enum reflection)
   - `XSIGMA_ENABLE_COMPRESSION` (Compression support)
   - `XSIGMA_COMPRESSION_TYPE` (Compression library selection)

6. **Logging Backend Configuration**
   - `XSIGMA_LOGGING_BACKEND` (NATIVE, LOGURU, or GLOG)

7. **Memory Allocation and Threading Configuration Flags**
   - `XSIGMA_ENABLE_MIMALLOC` (Microsoft mimalloc allocator)

8. **Platform-Specific Configuration and Feature Validation**
   - Platform-specific adjustments for NUMA, Memkind, and Sanitizer

9. **Feature Configuration Validation and Setup**
   - Compression configuration validation

10. **Global Project Variables**
    - Source, binary, and version directories

11. **Build Library Type Configuration**
    - `XSIGMA_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` (Shared vs. static libraries)

### 4. Documentation Comments

Each flag now includes:
- **Purpose**: What the flag controls
- **Behavior**: What happens when enabled/disabled
- **Dependencies**: Any platform or feature constraints
- **Examples**: Usage context where applicable

## Benefits

1. **Improved Organization**: Feature flags are now co-located with their implementation
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Include guards prevent multiple inclusions
3. **Better Maintainability**: Clear section organization in main CMakeLists.txt
4. **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive comments explain each flag's purpose
5. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find flag definitions and their modules
6. **Scalability**: New features can follow the established pattern

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Flag names and defaults remain unchanged
- Module inclusion order is preserved
- All existing functionality is maintained
- No breaking changes to the build system

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify all flags are still accessible from the main CMakeLists.txt
2. Test that modules are not included multiple times
3. Confirm that feature-specific flags work correctly in their modules
4. Validate that platform-specific logic still functions as expected
